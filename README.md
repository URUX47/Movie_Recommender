# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A simple ML-based movie recommender built with **Streamlit**. It uses content-based filtering with `CountVectorizer` and **cosine similarity** to suggest similar movies. The model is saved as `model.pkl` for fast performance.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
